    "## 3. Implementing the Orchestrator with Task and Progress Ledgers\n",
    "\n",
    "The Orchestrator is the \"brain\" of the system. Unlike simple routers, it uses two structured ledgers to maintain state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Task Ledger (Outer Loop)\n",
    "Maintains long-term memory:\n",
    "1.  **Given/Verified Facts**: Ground truth discovered during the task (e.g., \"MFA is enabled for all users\").\n",
    "2.  **Facts to Look Up**: Missing information required for the plan (e.g., \"What is the current Conditional Access policy?\").\n",
    "3.  **Educated Guesses**: Hypotheses to guide agents when stuck (e.g., \"MFA exemption might exist for break-glass accounts\").\n",
    "4.  **Task Plan**: The high-level sequence of steps (e.g., \"1. Navigate to Azure AD → 2. Extract MFA report → 3. Compare against policy\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Progress Ledger (Inner Loop)\n",
    "Maintains short-term execution state:\n",
    "*   **Is the task complete?** (Requires evidence screenshot for \"yes\")\n",
    "*   **Is the team looping?** (Triggers Stall Counter)\n",
    "*   **Is progress being made?** (Used to detect \"thrashing\")\n",
    "*   **Who is the next speaker?** (Agent routing)\n",
    "*   **What is the specific instruction for them?** (Task delegation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Stall Counter (Research-Validated)\n",
    "> *\"If a loop is detected, or there is a lack of forward progress, the counter is incremented. Once the counter reaches 2, the Orchestrator breaks from the inner loop, returning control back to the outer loop.\"* — Fourney et al. (2024), §3.1\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevents the agent from looping indefinitely on failed strategies—critical for forensic auditing where every action is logged and billed."
